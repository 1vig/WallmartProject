# Walmart Sales Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict sales data from Walmart stores. The dataset includes various features such as store location, department, date, and sales figures. The goal is to gain insights from the data, build predictive models, and understand the factors that influence sales.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure and distribution of the data, and identify key features that influence sales.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that could improve the predictive power of the models.
- **Model Building**: Develop and train machine learning models to predict sales.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and refine them for better accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to showcase the insights and results of the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Walmart and includes information on various aspects of store sales, such as:
- Store number
- Department number
- Date of sales
- Weekly sales figures
- Holiday events
- Temperature
- Fuel price
- CPI (Consumer Price Index)
- Unemployment rate

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis, model building, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/1vig/walmart-sales-prediction.git
    cd walmart-sales-prediction
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks** to explore the data, build models, and visualize results:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Results

The project demonstrates the process of analyzing and predicting Walmart sales using machine learning models. The results include:
- Data visualizations that highlight trends and insights from the dataset.
- Trained models with performance metrics.
- A detailed analysis of the factors affecting sales.
